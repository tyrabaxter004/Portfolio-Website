# Portfolio-Website
This is my personal portfolio website will give you more information about me and my academic career. I also have linked the different projects I have worked on. Another cool feature is my personal chatbot on my website, feel free to ask it any questions related to my work experience, education, or contact information 

How to Run 
This is the link to my website  https://tyrabaxter004.github.io/Portfolio-Website/

Chatbot Implementation  
I was able to implement my chatbot by using the Dialogflow framework. It allowed me to build out my chatbot, then with the Dialogflow messenger tool I was able to add it directly to my website’s index file.
